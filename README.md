# mydemosite
Containerized Static website with Dockerfile

Purpose is to create a website that can be deployed as a container - used in Spinnaker demos

For simple edits make changes to www/index.html 
look for "TODAY IS" or "Spinnaker Demo"

TODO: make fancier edits - maybe add js to implement new scrolling behavior - or move the tool bar?
